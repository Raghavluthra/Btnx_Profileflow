ASSESSMENT


About the Mini project -->

Here’s the details of the Blazor project we’d like you to create. 

1. The sample app must have at least 2 pages (views). 
2. One page should be used to input a person’s profile data (example id, first name, last name, email address, phone, etc.)
3. Another should be used to update the person’s profile.
4. The pages should post their data to web api endpoints that are also within the project. 
   You can create the webapi in standard api controllers or in minimal web apis.
5. Since it’s not necessary to use a database, you can store the data in-memory objects.
